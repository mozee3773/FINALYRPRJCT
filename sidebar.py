        ### :thought_balloon: Purpose 
        \nThe fashion industry is a highly demanding and fast-growing sector, 
        with new trends emerging every day. 
        In order to keep up with the latest trends and meet the demands of consumers, 
        the industry needs to constantly innovate and adopt the latest technologies.
        One of the key elements in the design of fashion is fashion illustrations,
        which provide a visual representation of several design concepts. 
        Fashion illustrations have been essential in the design of fashion since the beginning of clothing.
        
        \nHowever, the process of converting hand-drawn sketches into coloured
        designs can be time-consuming and tedious, taking up valuable 
        time that could be spent on other important aspects of the design process. 
        To address this issue, our proposed system provides a platform to automate
        the conversion of hand-drawn sketches into colourful images.
        
        \nBy utilizing the latest technology, our proposed system can
        significantly reduce the time and effort required to convert 
        hand-drawn sketches into coloured designs, providing fashion 
        designers with a more efficient and streamlined workflow. 
        This automated design system has the potential to revolutionize 
        the fashion industry by increasing the speed and accuracy of 
        the design process, and enabling designers to focus more on creativity and innovation.
